                <p>
                   <b>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam 15 October 1931,</b> 27 July 2015 was an Indian aerospace scientist and statesman who served as
                    the 11th president of India from 2002 to 2007. He was born and raised in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu and studied physics and aerospace engineering. He spent the 
                    next four decades as a scientist and science administrator, mainly at the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research 
                    Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately involved in India's civilian space programme and military missile development efforts. He thus came to be known as
                    the Missile Man of India for his work on the development of ballistic missile and launch vehicle technology. He also played a pivotal organisational, 
                    technical, and political role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, the first since the original nuclear test by India in 1974.
